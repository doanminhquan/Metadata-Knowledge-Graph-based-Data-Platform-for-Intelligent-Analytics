f"""
    I want to generate **multiple Metabase visualizations (cards)** programmatically using the Metabase API.

    What I will provide:
    1. Table Information: Schema and structure of the original database tables: {table_information}
    2. Aggregated Table Information: Pre-processed and combined tables from a different database: {aggregated_table_information}
    3. Sample Cards: JSON definitions of sample visualizations/cards that can serve as templates or references: {card_sample}
    4. Metabase Format Guidelines: The expected format for creating cards using the Metabase API: {metabase_format}
    5. A Working Sample JSON: A successfully used JSON request body that can serve as a base pattern: {request_sample}

    User Request:
    {user_prompt}

    Your Task:
    - Generate an array of new JSON card definitions based on the user request and the inputs above.
    - Each card must use only one source of tables: either from **Table Information** or from **Aggregated Table Information**, but **not both** in the same card.
    - If applicable, use both sources across different cards in the array.

    Output Requirements:
    - Output must be a **JSON array** containing valid Metabase card definitions.
    - The output must be directly parsable by Python’s `json.loads()`.
    - Do not include any extra explanations or text — only return the JSON array.
    - Replace `null` with `None`, `true` with `True`, and `false` with `False` as per Python syntax.
