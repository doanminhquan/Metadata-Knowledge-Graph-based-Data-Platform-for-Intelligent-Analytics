I want to generate Metabase visualizations (cards) programmatically using the Metabase API.
What I will provide:
Table Information: Schema and structure of the tables available for visualization: {table_information}
Sample Cards: JSON definitions of sample visualizations/cards that can serve as templates or references: {card_sample}
Metabase Format Guidelines: The expected format for creating cards using the Metabase API: {metabase_format}
A Working Sample JSON: A successfully used JSON request body that can serve as a base pattern: {request_sample}
Your Task: Based on the inputs above, generate a new JSON card definition based on the following request: {user_query}
Output in JSON format like the sample JSON request. Just output for me the JSON request body (no additional content like words or anything else).

Some important notes:
- null values in JSON should be replaced with None
- true/false values should be replaced with True/False
